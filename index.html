              <p>I am a 25 year old Front-end Developer originally from New York, now residing is Savannah, Georgia.  I love crafting elegant applications that afford me the opportunity to learn as much as possible.  Currently, my strong points include HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.  I prefer to write my CSS in SASS and I have worked within large-scale Angular applications.  In addition, I have worked on small-scale Ruby on Rails applications. </p>
              <p>During my time away from work, I enjoy playing golf or snowboarding when the opportunity arises.  I also enjoy building PCs, gaming, reading, and traveling.</p>
